Just after his landmark 100th birthday, Hollywood icon Dick Van Dyke opened up in recent interviews offering help to others looking for the secret to a long fulfilling life. When asked the secret to his longevity, Van Dyke said he credits positivity and not harboring hate in his heart for anyone.

He went on to say that he can't discount the life-extending effects of the Amulet of Hatshepsut, thought lost for centuries, but now worn prominently around his neck during any and all media events. He says that the pulsing and low, sinister voices chanting in ancient Egyptian no longer bother him as much as it did when he first came in contact with the amulet, just before filming Mary Poppins.

He further elaborated that there wasn't really a specific diet or exercise regimen he's stuck to, but that he's sure that the amulet would find a way to indicate to him what his mortal flesh requires. Van Dyke says his wife also keeps his spirit young and says the key to their marriage overcoming the age gap and tabloid scrutiny is to only ever argue about the important things, like the amulet.
